Review the current work: $ARGUMENTS

1. Commit any uncommitted work
2. Create a PR if one doesn't exist
3. Review the PR

**PR Review Workflow**

Pull request reviews should mirror real-world team practices where multiple reviewers sign off before merging. Invoke **at least 3 agents in parallel** to provide comprehensive review coverage:

Standard reviewer combination:
- **pact-architect**: Design coherence, architectural patterns, interface contracts, separation of concerns
- **pact-test-engineer**: Test coverage, testability, performance implications, edge cases
- **Domain specialist coder** (selected below): Implementation quality specific to the domain

Select the domain coder based on PR focus:
- Frontend changes → **pact-frontend-coder** (UI implementation quality, accessibility, state management)
- Backend changes → **pact-backend-coder** (Server-side implementation quality, API design, error handling)
- Database changes → **pact-database-engineer** (Query efficiency, schema design, data integrity)
- Multiple domains → Coder for domain with most significant changes, or all relevant domain coders if changes are equally significant

**After all reviews complete**: Synthesize findings into a unified review summary with consolidated recommendations, noting areas of agreement and any conflicting opinions.
