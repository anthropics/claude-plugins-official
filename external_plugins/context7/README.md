# Context7 MCP - Up-to-date Code Docs For Any Prompt

## Why Context7?

**Without Context7**, LLMs rely on outdated or generic training data:
- Code examples based on year-old information
- Hallucinated APIs that don't exist
- Generic answers for old package versions

**With Context7**, you get up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source.

## Usage

Add `use context7` to your prompt:

```
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT. use context7
```

```
Configure a Cloudflare Worker to cache JSON API responses. use context7
```

## Available Tools

- **resolve-library-id**: Resolves a library name into a Context7-compatible library ID
- **get-library-docs**: Fetches documentation for a library using its Context7 ID
