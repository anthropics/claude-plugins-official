## Overview

The Watcher's core gameplay revolves around three unique stances: **Wrath**, **Calm**, and **Divinity**. Mastering stance transitions ("stance dancing") is essential for Watcher success.

## Wrath Stance

### Effects

- **Damage Dealt:** 2x multiplier (doubles all damage you deal)
- **Damage Taken:** 2x multiplier (doubles all damage you receive)

### Entry Cards

- Eruption (2 energy → 1 upgraded, deals 9 damage, enter Wrath)
- Crescendo (0 energy, skill, Exhaust)
- Indignation (1 energy, skill)
- Tantrum (1 energy, deals 3 damage 3 times, shuffles back into draw pile)

### Strategy

- Use Wrath for burst damage windows
- Exit before enemy attacks to avoid taking 2x damage
- Pairs well with Mental Fortress (gain block on stance change)

---

## Calm Stance

### Effects

- **While In Calm:** No immediate effect
- **On Exit:** Gain **2 Energy** (3 Energy with Violet Lotus relic)

### Entry Cards

- Vigilance (2 energy → 1 upgraded, gain 8 → 12 block, enter Calm)
- Tranquility (1 energy, skill, Retain)
- Inner Peace (1 energy, skill)
- Fear No Evil (1 energy, attack, conditional)
- Meditate (1 energy, skill, Retain 2 → 3 cards from discard)

### Strategy

- Enter Calm to set up powerful next turns
- Exit Calm to gain energy for combos
- **Stance Dancing:** Calm exit (2 energy) + 1-cost Wrath entry = +1 net energy

---

## Divinity Stance

### Entry Requirement

- Accumulate **10 Mantra** (or play Blasphemy)

### Effects

- **Damage Multiplier:** 3x (triples all damage you deal)
- **Energy Gain:** +3 Energy immediately upon entering
- **Duration:** Lasts until end of current turn, auto-exits at start of next turn

### Mantra Sources

- Prostrate (0 energy, 2 Mantra, 4 block)
- Pray (1 energy, 3 Mantra)
- Worship (2 energy, 5 Mantra, upgraded gains Retain)
- Devotion (rare power, 2 → 3 Mantra per turn)
- Damaru relic (1 Mantra at start of each turn)
- Blasphemy (1 energy, instant Divinity, **DIE NEXT TURN**)

### Strategy

- Build Divinity via Devotion power for consistent access
- Time Divinity turns for maximum burst damage (killing elites/bosses)
- Blasphemy is "win now" card - must kill that turn or use Vault

## Stance-Related Relics

| Relic               | Rarity   | Effect                                    |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Violet Lotus**    | Boss     | Exiting Calm grants 3 Energy instead of 2 |
| **Damaru**          | Common   | Gain 1 Mantra at start of each turn       |
| **Teardrop Locket** | Uncommon | Start each combat in Calm stance          |

## Key Mechanics

### Energy Economy

- Calm exit (2 energy) + 1-cost Wrath entry = +1 net energy per cycle
- With Violet Lotus: Calm exit (3 energy) = +2 net energy per cycle
- Miracle from Pure Water = flexible +1 energy

### Stance Dance Math

- With Mental Fortress+: 6 block per stance change
- Wrath → Calm → Wrath in one turn = 12 block + 2 energy gain
- Sustainable indefinitely with proper card cycling

### Damage Calculations

- **Wrath:** 10 damage card becomes 20 damage
- **Divinity:** 10 damage card becomes 30 damage (+ 3 energy gained)
- **Divinity in Wrath:** Not possible (can't be in two stances)

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Staying in Wrath too long** - Taking 2x damage is dangerous
2. **Entering Calm without exit plan** - Wasting the energy refund
3. **Building Mantra without Devotion** - Too slow for Divinity
4. **Playing Blasphemy without lethal** - You die next turn
