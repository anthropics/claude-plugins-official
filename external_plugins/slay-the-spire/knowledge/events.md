## 4. Neow Bonuses

Neow's bonuses depend on your previous run's progress:

### Two-Option Variant (Failed to reach Act 1 Boss)

1. **Gain Max HP** (+6-8 depending on character)
2. **Neow's Lament** → Enemies in next 3 combats have 1 HP

**Optimal Choice**: Neow's Lament if you can path to an early elite within 3 fights (guaranteed relic/rare card). Otherwise, take Max HP.

### Four-Option Variant (Reached Act 1 Boss)

Neow presents 4 random options from these categories:

#### High-Value Options (Usually Best)

| Bonus                         | Notes                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neow's Lament**             | Best if early elite accessible                    |
| **Gain 250 Gold**             | Excellent if early shop accessible                |
| **Remove 2 Cards**            | Powerful deck-thinning (great for Watcher)        |
| **Choose a Rare Card**        | Can be run-defining (Immolate, Die Die Die, etc.) |
| **Choose Uncommon Colorless** | Hand of Greed or Apotheosis = incredible          |
| **Obtain Random Rare Relic**  | High variance but often powerful                  |

#### Moderate Options

| Bonus                        | Notes                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Random Common Relic**      | Safe, reliable choice              |
| **Gain 100 Gold**            | Decent, less valuable than 250     |
| **Remove 1 Card**            | Good, but less than 2 removals     |
| **Upgrade 1 Card**           | Situational (Eruption for Watcher) |
| **Choose a Card (3 random)** | Decent for early deck shaping      |

#### Risky High-Reward Options

| Bonus                     | Cost                       | Reward                | Notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boss Swap**             | Lose starter relic         | Random boss relic     | High variance; energy relics are great, but Ectoplasm/Sozu/Busted Crown early = rough. Less risky for Defect/Watcher. |
| **Choose Rare Card**      | Lose Max HP or take damage | Choose rare card      | Strong if card pool is good                                                                                           |
| **Choose Rare Colorless** | Lose Max HP or take damage | Choose rare colorless | Excellent if you hit Apotheosis/Hand of Greed                                                                         |
| **Gain 250 Gold**         | Obtain Curse               | 250 gold              | Only if curse removal available                                                                                       |

#### Avoid Options

| Bonus                        | Notes                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3 Random Potions**         | Least valuable; potions can be found elsewhere         |
| **Transform 1-2 Cards**      | Too random, often underwhelming                        |
| **Obtain Curse (bad trade)** | Curses hinder deck; avoid unless reward is exceptional |
