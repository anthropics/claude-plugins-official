# Claude Plugins

Anthropic's own plugins for Claude, and the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace for Claude Code.

> **Submitting a plugin?** Submit it at **[claude.ai/directory/manage](https://claude.ai/directory/manage)**. Plugins accepted there are served across Claude products. Pull requests to this repository are not monitored.

## What is changing

- **All plugins are now submitted at [claude.ai/directory/manage](https://claude.ai/directory/manage)**, and are served across Claude products from there.
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is being phased out for third-party plugins.** It will be reduced over time to Anthropic's own plugins.
- **This repository is the home of Anthropic's own plugins.** Its checks cover the plugin folders here, not the plugins hosted in other repositories.

> **⚠️ Important:** Make sure you trust a plugin before installing, updating, or using it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they will work as intended or that they won't change. See each plugin's homepage for more information.

## Structure

- **`/plugins`** - Internal plugins developed and maintained by Anthropic
- **`/external_plugins`** - Third-party plugins added before submissions moved to [claude.ai/directory/manage](https://claude.ai/directory/manage), and Anthropic's channel plugins (Discord, fakechat, iMessage and Telegram)

## Installation

Plugins can be installed directly from this marketplace via Claude Code's plugin system.

To install, run `/plugin install {plugin-name}@claude-plugins-official`

or browse for the plugin in `/plugin > Discover`

## Contributing

### Third-party plugins

Submit and manage your plugin at [claude.ai/directory/manage](https://claude.ai/directory/manage). Do not open a pull request here: pull requests are not monitored, and `marketplace.json` is being reduced to Anthropic's own plugins.

### Anthropic plugins

Plugins in `/plugins` are developed by Anthropic team members. See `/plugins/example-plugin` for a reference implementation. Every folder there is checked on each pull request, whether or not `marketplace.json` lists it.

## Plugin Structure

Each plugin follows a standard structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      # Plugin metadata (required)
├── .mcp.json            # MCP server configuration (optional)
├── commands/            # Slash commands (optional)
├── agents/              # Agent definitions (optional)
├── skills/              # Skill definitions (optional)
└── README.md            # Documentation
```

## Plugin names are immutable

The `name` field in a marketplace entry is an **immutable slug**. Once a plugin has been published, its `name` must not change — users have it installed under that slug, and renaming it breaks their install with a `plugin-not-found` error.

- To change how a plugin is labeled in the UI, set or update `displayName` instead.
- If a rename is genuinely unavoidable, add an entry to the top-level `renames` map in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so existing installs auto-migrate:

```json
"renames": {
  "old-name": "new-name"
}
```

The Claude Code plugin loader reads this map and transparently rewrites the old slug to the new one on the user's next sync.

## Skill-bundle plugins

When a plugin's source repository ships skills (`SKILL.md` files) without a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest, the marketplace entry can declare the skills directly using `strict: false` and an explicit `skills` array.

```json
{
  "name": "example-bundle",
  "description": "Brief description of the bundled skills.",
  "author": { "name": "Author Name" },
  "category": "development",
  "source": {
    "source": "git-subdir",
    "url": "https://github.com/example-org/sdk.git",
    "path": "packages/agent-skills",
    "ref": "main",
    "sha": "<commit sha>"
  },
  "strict": false,
  "skills": [
    "./skill-a",
    "./skill-b",
    "./skill-c"
  ],
  "homepage": "https://github.com/example-org/sdk"
}
```

Each path in `skills` is relative to `source.path` and points at a directory containing a `SKILL.md`. Paths can reach deeper than a single level — for example, `["./libA/skill-1", "./libB/skill-2"]` exposes a curated subset across multiple library subdirectories. Each skill is registered as `<plugin-name>:<skill-name>` in Claude Code.
