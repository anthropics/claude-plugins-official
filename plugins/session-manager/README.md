# Session Manager Plugin

List and resume Claude Code sessions for the current working directory.

## Overview

Claude Code saves conversation sessions per project directory under `~/.claude/projects/`. This plugin provides a simple `/sessions` command to discover and display all saved sessions for your current working directory, making it easy to pick up where you left off.

## Commands

### `/session-manager:sessions`

Lists all available Claude Code sessions for the current working directory.

**What it does:**
1. Resolves the current working directory to its Claude project path
2. Lists all saved session files (`.jsonl`) for that directory
3. Displays each session ID with its last-modified timestamp
4. Shows the command to resume any session

**Usage:**
```
/session-manager:sessions
```

**Example output:**
```
Available Claude Code sessions for /Users/you/my-project:

To resume a session, run:
  claude --resume <session-id>
```

**Features:**

- Works on macOS and Linux
